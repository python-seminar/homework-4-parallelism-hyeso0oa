Homework 4: Implementing the Monte Carlo dart-throwing simulation to
calculate a numerical approximation to Pi. We tried to implement the simulation
using Ipython parallel module and Multiprocess and compared the execution time of each method
with the execution time without any parallel computing. 

Interpretation:
When the number of darts is small, a system without parallel computing was fast because assigning part of work to several worker processes or ipcluster controllers and delivering the data between those worker processes or controllers
and ipython kernel takes time. This additional time for parallel computing was significant compared to the time to run the simulation.

However, when the number of darts is big, a system without parallel computing was slower because massive workloads were divided into many worker processes or ipcluster controllers, and this allocation reduces the execution time a lot. The time to transfer data between ipython kernel and those worker process or ipcluster controllers is no longer significant compared to the time to run the simulations.

All plot was generated on MacBook Pro with 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5 with dual core.
